## Overview
For this challenge, the task was to utilize Anaconda, Jupyter Labs Notebook, and Python to perform an analysis of two separate datasets consisting of:
- School data (16 rows)
- Student data (39,171 rows)

During coursework exercise, this data would be summarized into dataframes according to:
- passing reading, math, and overall scores (>= 70) in terms of count and percentage
- binned grouping analysis by school type, spending per student, and school size

During challenge portion of the exercise, it was given 9th grade scores for a specific school (Thomas High School) were altered.  To address, challenge was to remove 9th grade reading & math scores from the data for all schools, repeat analysis performed during coursework exercise, and compare difference in summary.

<!---Results:
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).--->
