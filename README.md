## Overview
For this challenge, the task was to utilize Anaconda, Jupyter Labs Notebook, and Python to perform an analysis of two separate datasets consisting of:
- School data (16 rows)
- Student data (39,171 rows)

During coursework exercise, this data would be summarized into dataframes according to:
- passing reading, math, and overall scores (>= 70) in terms of count and percentage
- binned grouping analysis by school type, spending per student, and school size

During challenge portion of the exercise, it was given 9th grade scores for a specific school (Thomas High School) were altered.  To address, challenge was to remove 9th grade reading & math scores from the data for all schools, repeat analysis performed during coursework exercise, and compare difference in summary.

<!---Results:
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).--->
## Results
Identification & highlight of differences as a result of setting Thomas High School 9th grade reading & math scores to "NaN".

For District Summary:
- Average Math Score reduced by 0.1
- % Passing Math reduced by 0.2%
- % Passing Reading reduced by 0.1%
- % Overall Passing reduced by 0.3%

For Per School Summary & Thomas High School specifically:
- Average Math Score change from 83.418 to 83.351
- Average Reading Score change from 83.849 to 83.896
- % Passing Math change from 93.272% to 93.186%
- % Passing Reading from 97.309% to 97.019%
- % Overall Passing from 90.948% to 90.630%

For comparisons by Spending, Size, and Type:
- Spending experienced the most change due to removal of Thomas High School 9th grade scores.
  - Thomas High School is in the $630~$644 bin and all summary values changed by some small amount (see image insert)
- For Size, Thomas High School was in the Medium (1000-2000) bin & only change was from % Passing Reading by 0.1%
- For School Type comparison, Thomas High School was in the Charter bin and there was no measureable difference in summary result.
